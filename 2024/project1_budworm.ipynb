        "A practical model which exhibits two positive linearly stable steady state populations is that for the spruce budworm which can, with ferocious efficiency, defoliate the balsam fir; it is a major problem in Canada. Ludwig et al. (\"Qualitative analysis of insect outbreak systems: the spruce budworm and forest\", 1978) considered the budworm population dynamics to be modelled by the equation:\n",

        "\n",
        "Here $r_B$ is the linear birth rate of the budworm and $K_B$ is the carrying capacity which is related to the density of foliage (food) available on the trees. The $p(N)$-term represents predation, generally by birds: its qualitative form is important. Predation usually saturates for large enough $N$.\n",
        "A suggestion is to use $p(N) = \\frac{B N^2}{A^2 + N^2}$, which goes to zero for small $N$s and to $B/A^2$ if $N→∞$.\n",

        "\n",

        "Notice that there are only two parameters: $r$ and $q$. The solutions $u(\\tau)$ , their shape and characteristics will depend on $r$ and $q$.\n",
        "In particular, you should be able to find the steady states solutions, and understand their stability.\n",
